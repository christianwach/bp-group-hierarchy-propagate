BP Group Hierarchy Propagate
============================

The *BP Group Hierarchy Propagate* plugin enables propagation of Activity Items *up*, *down* or *up and down* a hierarchy of BuddyPress Groups established by the *BP Group Hierarchy* plugin.

Note: this plugin has been developed and tested using BuddyPress 1.7+ and requires at least BP Group Hierarchy 1.4.2 if you want to switch the direction of propagation. The switch can be found on the BP Group Hierarchy settings page.

If you're a developer, I'd welcome your contributions. If not, it's probably better to install this plugin from the [WordPress Plugin Directory](http://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-group-hierarchy-propagate/).

## Installation ##
